## Description
This is the iOS client for Convertr built on top of [convertr-core](https://github.com/Quite-nice/convertr-core). The client is written in [Swift 3](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/) with full support for iOS 10.

## Running the project
This project uses Swift 3 and thus requires Xcode version 8 or higher.

## Managing dependencies
One of the goals of this project is for us to try out new things. As we already have experience with CocoaPods, we will either choose [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or the Swift package manager for managing dependencies. At this point in time no final decision has been made.
